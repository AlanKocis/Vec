# Vec

Apparently you can just do the whole thing with C using malloc and realloc in considerably fewer lines. I still think this was a good exercise in navigating dynamic arrays that change in size using exclusively the 'new' keyword

----------------

Atempt at recreating the C++ std::vector class using dynamically allocated memory.
The solution can be opened in Visual Studio, or the class itself can be used by downloading only the Vec.h and Vec.cpp files :)
